Drink all your cares away, Who wants to die with a thirst? Die with a thirst! \nKnock back a fiery flin, amid the smoke and ash. Drain the flask of whiskey we'll be drunk in a flash! Let's guzzle sujamma amid the fire and fumes Tip back the jar of liquor let inebriation bloom! As the world ends, let inebriation bloom!
